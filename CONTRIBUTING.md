## Quick Start
Install dependencies:
```shell
pnpm install
```
Install `android-studio` on yor system: https://developer.android.com/studio
Install `ndk` within `android-studio`: Settings > Languages & Frameworks > SDK Tools
Set the `NDK_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME` PATH variables (ANDROID_HOME can be seen in Settings > Languages & Frameworks):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=YOUR_PATH/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH

export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/29.0.13113456
export PATH=$PATH:$NDK_HOME
```

Initialize Android project:
```shell
pnpm tauri android init
```

## Project structure
[Feature sliced design](https://feature-sliced.github.io/documentation/docs) was chosen initially because
1. It is documented, so no need to describe project structure explicitly
2. It looks quite logical and follows common development approach
3. There is a linter and other tools available to manage project structure
4. It claims to loosen coupling if followed it's linter rules
5. It tries to merge technical partitioning(slices) and domain partitioning (`features` layer)

However issues are present: FSD primarily focused on frontend development, 
while this project is full-stack. So it has it trade-offs.
