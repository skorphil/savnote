# SavNote Vision (draft)
22 march 2025

## Vision
SavNote exists to provide a simple, private, and effortless way to track savings — without complexity, pressure, or unnecessary features. It is for those who value financial awareness but don’t want the burden of traditional finance apps.

We envision SavNote as a trusted, lightweight tool that remains free, open-source, and adaptable — ensuring anyone can track their savings on their own terms, with full control over their data.

## Core Values
SavNote is built on the following principles:

- Data Ownership → User data stays on device and remains accessible, even without the app.
- Privacy → User data is encrypted and protected by a password.
- Android-First → Designed for a seamless mobile experience.
- Extensibility → Open-source and built on cross-platform framework, so enyone can customize and adapt it for their needs.


## Roadmap / Next Steps
v1.0.0: 
- Core features (create, edit records)
- basic widgets (Savings trend, earning to overall assets ratio)

v2.0.0: 
- Additional widgets (Adjustment for inflation, distribution across currencies, distribution across institutions)

v3.0.0:
- Unified interface for creating widgets so users can use their own widgets
