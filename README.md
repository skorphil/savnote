# SavNote – private savings notebook
SavNote is a simple app to consolidate all your savings and provide a clear understanding of your net worth.

How it works:
1. Record your initial savings balances in each institution (e.g., bank, broker, cryptocurrency wallet) and currency.
2. Update your balances at regular intervals (monthly or less often) by recording only the changes since the last update.
3. SavNote will store your records and provide a clear overview of your savings.


## Project Vision
**Q:** How is it different from the other finance trackers?

**A:** SavNote is a _savings notebook_, not finance tracker. It's designed to consolidate personal savings in a manner of a simple notebook, without the hassle of budgeting, goals or recording income and expences. With SavNote you can get a clear overview of all your net worth by spending no more than 10 min per month to record your savings. You can read more about vision and rationale behind SavNote in [wiki | vision](https://github.com/skorphil/savnote/wiki/SavNote-Vision).


## Core Values
* **Data ownership**: You have full control over your data, which is stored locally on your device. Your savings data remains accessible even if you uninstall the app, and you can use it independently of *SavNote*.
* **Data privacy**: Your data is encrypted and protected by a password, ensuring that only you can access it.
* **Android-first**: Android-centric design, focusing on delivering a seamless and intuitive mobile experience.
* **Extensibility**: SavNote is fully open-source, empowering you to extend, customize, and modify it to fit your needs. With a cross-platform foundation, you're also free to fork and adapt it for other platforms.
